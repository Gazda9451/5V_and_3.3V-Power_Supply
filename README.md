# 5V_and_3.3V-Power_Supply
A power supply has wall power as its input and outputs a steady 5V or 3.3V. Power MB V2 is used i.e. AMS1117-5V and AMS1117-3.3V fixed linear regulars are used. A 120V to 24V stepdown transformer is used to initially reduce the voltage. A  12V Zener diode is used to drop down the voltage further so it can be connected to the power MB V2 board.
